## üèóÔ∏è Design Philosophy & Architecture Principles

Our framework is built around several key principles that guide every architectural decision:

1. **Modularity Over Monolith**: Each component has a single, well-defined responsibility
2. **Configuration-Driven Development**: All parameters externalized through YAML configurations
3. **Adapter Pattern for Model Agnosticism**: Model-specific logic abstracted into adapters
4. **Separation of Concerns**: Data processing, model logic, and training orchestration cleanly separated
5. **Extensibility Through Abstraction**: Framework designed to accommodate new computer vision tasks

### Why This Architecture?

Traditional computer vision pipelines often suffer from tight coupling between data processing, model architecture, and training logic. Our architecture addresses these challenges by providing clear abstractions and standardized interfaces that enable rapid development and deployment of production-ready computer vision solutions.

## üéØ Understanding Tasks in Our Framework

### What is a "Task"?

A "task" in our framework represents a specific computer vision problem type. Each task is a self-contained module that implements a complete pipeline for solving that particular problem. Tasks are designed to be independent, reusable, and extensible.

### Common Task Types

Our framework supports various computer vision tasks, each with its own specialized requirements:

- **Classification Tasks**: Assign class labels to entire images
- **Detection Tasks**: Locate and classify objects within images using bounding boxes
- **Segmentation Tasks**: Perform pixel-level classification (semantic, instance, or panoptic)
- **Keypoint Tasks**: Detect specific points of interest in images
- **Custom Tasks**: Any specialized computer vision problem

### Task Architecture Components

Every task in our framework follows a consistent architecture with these core components:

#### 1. **Configuration Management**
Each task defines its own configuration classes that specify:
- **Model Configuration**: Architecture parameters, training settings, evaluation metrics
- **Data Configuration**: Dataset paths, preprocessing options, augmentation settings
- **Task-Specific Parameters**: Any unique requirements for that particular task

#### 2. **Data Management**
Tasks implement standardized data handling through:
- **Dataset Classes**: Extend PyTorch Dataset to handle task-specific annotations
- **Data Modules**: Extend PyTorch Lightning DataModule for complete data pipeline management
- **Data Adapters**: Handle model-specific preprocessing requirements

#### 3. **Model Implementation**
Each task provides:
- **Model Classes**: Extend PyTorch Lightning LightningModule for training orchestration
- **Architecture Support**: Integration with various model architectures (transformers, CNNs, etc.)
- **Task-Specific Logic**: Custom training, validation, and testing steps

#### 4. **Adapter System**
Tasks include specialized adapters for:
- **Input Adapters**: Convert raw data to model-specific formats
- **Output Adapters**: Standardize model outputs for evaluation and inference
- **Factory Functions**: Automatically select appropriate adapters based on model names (get_input_adapter, get_output_adapter)

#### 5. **Evaluation and Inference**
Tasks provide:
- **Evaluation Utilities**: Task-specific metrics and evaluation procedures
- **Inference Tools**: Prediction and visualization capabilities
- **Metric Computation**: Standardized evaluation across different model architectures

## üîç Detailed Technical Workflow

### 1. **Configuration Management: The Central Nervous System**

The configuration system serves as the foundation of our framework, using YAML for its human-readable format and hierarchical structure. Each task defines its own configuration dataclasses that provide type-safe configuration validation, catching errors early and ensuring parameter consistency.

#### Technical Implementation:
- **YAML Parsing**: Configuration files loaded using `yaml.safe_load()` and validated against dataclasses
- **Parameter Injection**: Each module receives only its relevant configuration section
- **Runtime Validation**: Additional checks ensure parameter compatibility across components

#### Design Rationale:
The hierarchical configuration approach mirrors our component separation, making it intuitive for users to understand which parameters affect which parts of the system. This approach enables reproducible experiments and easy parameter tuning without code changes.

### 2. **Data Management: From Raw Data to Model-Ready Batches**

The data management system is built on PyTorch Lightning's `LightningDataModule` abstraction, providing a complete data pipeline from raw annotations to model-ready batches.

#### Technical Components:

**Task-Specific Config Classes**: Define data loading parameters including paths, batch size, and processing options. This type-safe configuration ensures consistency across different data sources.

**Dataset Classes**: Extend PyTorch's `Dataset` class to handle task-specific annotations. Key methods include:
- `__getitem__(idx)`: Returns `(image, target)` tuple with PIL image and annotation dict
- `_load_image(idx)`: Loads PIL image from file path
- `_load_target(idx)`: Loads and formats annotations according to task requirements

**Data Module Classes**: Extend `LightningDataModule` and manage the complete data pipeline:
- `setup(stage)`: Initializes datasets for specified stage (fit/test)
- `train_dataloader()`, `val_dataloader()`, `test_dataloader()`: Create DataLoader instances
- `_collate_fn(batch)`: Custom batch collation converting tuples to dictionary format

#### Design Philosophy:
We chose COCO format as our primary data format because it's widely adopted, well-documented, and supports multiple computer vision tasks. The adapter-based preprocessing allows the same dataset to work with different model architectures without code changes.

### 3. **Model Management: Architecture-Agnostic Training**

The model management system provides a standardized interface for various computer vision models through task-specific model classes that extend PyTorch Lightning's `LightningModule`.

#### Technical Components:

**Task-Specific Config Classes**: Centralize model configuration including architecture, training parameters, and evaluation settings.

**Model Classes**: Main model classes that orchestrate training, validation, and testing:
- `_init_model()`: Uses Hugging Face's AutoModel classes for dynamic model loading
- `_init_metrics()`: Sets up task-specific metrics for all training stages
- `forward()`: Handles forward propagation with adapter integration
- `training_step()`, `validation_step()`, `test_step()`: Implement stage-specific logic
- `configure_optimizers()`: Sets up optimization with support for different learning rates

#### Training Optimization Features:
- **Gradient Clipping**: Prevents gradient explosion in transformer models
- **Learning Rate Scheduling**: Cosine annealing with warmup for stable training
- **Parameter Grouping**: Different learning rates for backbone vs. task-specific layers

#### Design Rationale:
By leveraging Hugging Face's AutoModel classes, we enable users to experiment with different architectures without code changes. The standardized LightningModule interface ensures consistent training workflows across different model types.

### 4. **Adapter Framework: The Bridge Between Components**

The adapter system provides model-agnostic data processing and output formatting through two main components: data adapters and output adapters.

#### Technical Components:

**Data Adapters**:
- **Base Adapter**: Abstract base class defining the adapter interface
- **Model-Specific Adapters**: Specialized adapters for different model architectures
- **No-Op Adapter**: Simple adapter for models requiring minimal preprocessing

**Output Adapters**:
- **Standardized Interface**: Common methods for all output adapters
- **Model-Specific Processing**: Handle different output formats from various models
- **Format Conversion**: Convert model outputs to standardized formats for evaluation

**Adapter Factory Functions**:
- `get_input_adapter(model_name, image_size)`: Returns appropriate input adapter
- `get_output_adapter(model_name)`: Returns appropriate output adapter

#### Design Philosophy:
Traditional approaches embed model-specific logic directly in data loaders or model classes, creating tight coupling. Our adapter approach isolates model-specific logic, enabling easy addition of new architectures without touching core training or data loading code.

### 5. **Unified Trainer: Orchestration and Scalability**

The `UnifiedTrainer` class orchestrates the entire training process, providing seamless integration between PyTorch Lightning, Ray, and MLflow.

#### Technical Components:

**UnifiedTrainer Class**: Main orchestrator with key methods:
- `_init_callbacks()`: Sets up `ModelCheckpoint`, `EarlyStopping`, and MLflow logging
- `_init_trainer()`: Configures PyTorch Lightning trainer for local or distributed training
- `train()`: Executes training process with data module setup
- `tune(search_space, num_trials)`: Runs hyperparameter optimization using Ray Tune

**Training Modes**:
- **Local Training**: Standard PyTorch Lightning training on single/multi-GPU
- **Distributed Training**: Ray-based distributed training across cluster nodes
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Automated optimization using Ray Tune with ASHAScheduler

#### Design Rationale:
The trainer automatically detects available resources and chooses appropriate training strategy. Ray integration provides excellent distributed computing capabilities, while MLflow ensures comprehensive experiment tracking and model versioning.

## üîÑ Module Integration & Communication Patterns

### Data Flow Architecture

The data flows through our system in a carefully orchestrated pipeline:

1. **Configuration Injection**: All components receive configuration at initialization via their respective config classes
2. **Data Processing Pipeline**: Raw data flows through `Dataset` ‚Üí `DataAdapter` ‚Üí `DataModule` ‚Üí `Model`
3. **Model Processing Pipeline**: Model outputs flow through `OutputAdapter` ‚Üí `Metrics` ‚Üí `Logging`
4. **Training Orchestration**: `UnifiedTrainer` coordinates all components while maintaining their independence

### Cross-Module Communication

We've designed the communication between modules to be explicit, stateless, testable, and extensible:
- **Explicit**: All data exchanges use well-defined interfaces (dictionary format for batches)
- **Stateless**: Components don't maintain state about other components
- **Testable**: Each communication point can be tested in isolation
- **Extensible**: New communication patterns can be added without breaking existing ones

## üöÄ Extensibility to New Computer Vision Tasks

### Framework Extensibility Philosophy

Our framework is designed with extensibility as a first-class concern. The same architectural patterns that work for existing tasks can be applied to new computer vision tasks with minimal modifications.

### Adding a New Task

To add support for a new computer vision task, follow these steps:

1. **Create Task Directory**: Add a new directory under `src/tasks/` for your task
2. **Implement Core Components**:
   - **Configuration**: Define task-specific config dataclasses
   - **Data Management**: Create dataset and data module classes
   - **Model Implementation**: Implement PyTorch Lightning model class
   - **Adapters**: Create input and output adapters for model support
   - **Evaluation**: Add task-specific evaluation utilities

3. **Follow Established Patterns**:
   - Use the same interface patterns as existing tasks
   - Implement the same abstract base classes
   - Follow the same configuration structure
   - Use the same adapter patterns

4. **Integration**: The new task automatically integrates with:
   - The unified trainer for distributed training
   - MLflow for experiment tracking
   - Ray for hyperparameter optimization
   - The existing configuration system

### Benefits of This Approach

- **Consistency**: All tasks follow the same architectural patterns
