# Databricks App Deployment - Fixed Guide

## ✅ Problem Fixed!

The "App Not Available" issue has been resolved. The problem was that the app code was trying to import from the parent directory, which doesn't exist or isn't accessible in the deployed Databricks app environment.

## Changes Made

All files have been updated to remove unnecessary parent directory path manipulation:
- `app.py` - Removed parent path imports
- All 8 page files in `pages/` directory - Removed parent path imports

The `lakehouse_app` is now fully self-contained and ready for deployment.

## Deployment Instructions

### Step 1: Navigate to Your Repository

In your Databricks workspace terminal:

```bash
cd /Workspace/Users/aradhya.chouhan@databricks.com/Databricks_CV_ref
```

### Step 2: (Optional) Stop/Delete Existing App

If you have a previously deployed app that's not working:

```bash
# Stop the app
databricks apps stop cv-training-pipeline

# Or delete it completely for a fresh start
databricks apps delete cv-training-pipeline
```

### Step 3: Deploy the App

Deploy using the relative path from the repository root:

```bash
databricks apps deploy cv-training-pipeline --source-code-path lakehouse_app
```

**Important Notes:**
- Use relative path `lakehouse_app` not absolute path
- Deploy from the repository root directory
- The command will automatically deploy all files within the `lakehouse_app` directory

### Step 4: Check App Logs

After deployment, check the logs to ensure everything is working:

```bash
databricks apps logs cv-training-pipeline
```

You should see output like:
```
You can now view your Streamlit app in your browser.
```

### Step 5: Access Your App

Once deployed successfully, you can access the app through:
1. Databricks workspace UI → Apps section
2. Click on `cv-training-pipeline`
3. Click "Open App" button

## Verification Steps

### Test Locally First (Recommended)

Before deploying to Databricks, test the app locally:

```bash
cd /Workspace/Users/aradhya.chouhan@databricks.com/Databricks_CV_ref/lakehouse_app
streamlit run app.py
```

If this works without errors, the deployment should also work.

### Check for Import Errors

Verify all imports work correctly:

```bash
cd /Workspace/Users/aradhya.chouhan@databricks.com/Databricks_CV_ref/lakehouse_app
python -c "from utils.config_generator import ConfigGenerator; print('Import successful!')"
python -c "from utils.state_manager import StateManager; print('Import successful!')"
python -c "from components.config_forms import ConfigFormBuilder; print('Import successful!')"
```

All should print "Import successful!" with no errors.

## App Structure (Self-Contained)

## Troubleshooting

### If App Still Shows "Not Available"

1. **Check logs immediately after deployment:**
   ```bash
   databricks apps logs cv-training-pipeline
   ```

2. **Look for specific errors:**
   - `ModuleNotFoundError` → Missing dependency in requirements.txt
   - `FileNotFoundError` → Missing files in deployment
   - `ImportError` → Syntax or import issues

3. **Verify deployment command:**
   ```bash
   # Correct ✅
   databricks apps deploy cv-training-pipeline --source-code-path lakehouse_app
   
   # Wrong ❌
   databricks apps deploy cv-training-pipeline --source-code-path /Workspace/Users/.../lakehouse_app
   ```

4. **Test app locally first:**
   ```bash
   cd lakehouse_app
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
   Fix any errors that appear locally before redeploying.

### Common Issues

#### Issue: "Cannot find module 'utils'"
**Solution:** Make sure `utils/__init__.py` exists and deploy from the correct directory.

#### Issue: "App shows active but still not available"
**Solution:** This usually means the app crashed on startup. Check logs for the actual error.

#### Issue: "Permission denied" errors
**Solution:** Ensure your Databricks user has permissions to deploy apps and access required resources.

## Expected Behavior After Fix

After deploying with the fixes:
1. App status should show as "RUNNING" or "ACTIVE"
2. App URL should load the Streamlit UI
3. You should see the main landing page with CV Training Pipeline interface
4. Navigation sidebar should show all 8 pages
5. No import errors in the logs

## Next Steps

Once the app is successfully deployed:
1. Navigate through the pages to verify all functionality works
2. Try creating a configuration in the Config Setup page
3. Test the different features of the pipeline
4. Monitor app performance and logs for any issues

## Support

If you encounter any issues after following this guide:
1. Share the output of `databricks apps logs cv-training-pipeline`
2. Share the exact deployment command you used
3. Mention any error messages you see in the UI
