# 🚀 Quick Fix Summary - Your App is Now Ready!

## What Was Wrong?

Your Databricks app was crashing on startup because the code was trying to access the parent directory (`Path(__file__).parent.parent`) which doesn't exist or isn't accessible in the deployed app environment.

## What Was Fixed?

✅ Removed unnecessary parent directory imports from:
- `app.py`
- All 8 page files in `pages/` directory

The app is now **fully self-contained** and ready for deployment!

## 🎯 Your Next Steps (3 Simple Commands)

### 1. Navigate to your repo
```bash
cd /Workspace/Users/aradhya.chouhan@databricks.com/Databricks_CV_ref
```

### 2. Delete the broken app
```bash
databricks apps delete cv-training-pipeline
```

### 3. Redeploy with the fix
```bash
databricks apps deploy cv-training-pipeline --source-code-path lakehouse_app
```

### 4. Check the logs
```bash
databricks apps logs cv-training-pipeline
```

You should see: `You can now view your Streamlit app in your browser.`

## ✨ Expected Result

After redeployment, your app will:
- Load successfully at the app URL
- Show the CV Training Pipeline landing page
- Display all 8 navigation pages in the sidebar
- Be fully functional!

## 📝 Key Change in Deployment

**Before (Wrong):**
```bash
databricks apps deploy cv-training-pipeline \
  --source-code-path /Workspace/Users/aradhya.chouhan@databricks.com/databricks-cv-accelerator/lakehouse_app
```

**After (Correct):**
```bash
cd /Workspace/Users/aradhya.chouhan@databricks.com/Databricks_CV_ref
databricks apps deploy cv-training-pipeline --source-code-path lakehouse_app
```

## 🔍 If You Still Have Issues

Check the logs for the actual error:
```bash
databricks apps logs cv-training-pipeline
```

The most common remaining issues are:
1. **Missing dependencies** - Check `requirements.txt` has all packages
2. **Permission issues** - Ensure you have app deployment permissions
3. **Databricks resource access** - App needs access to workspace APIs
